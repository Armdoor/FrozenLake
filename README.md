<h1>FrozenLake Q-Learning Visualization</h1>

This repository provides code to visualize a Q-learning agent's behavior in the FrozenLake environment using Pygame and OpenCV.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
Python 3.x</ul>
<ul>Pygame</ul>
<ul>OpenCV</ul>
<ul>IPython (for Jupyter Notebook usage)</ul>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The project consists of the following key components:

<b>FrozenLake Class</b>
Defines the FrozenLake environment, including:
  <ul>Grid layout</ul>
  <ul> State and action spaces</ul>
  <ul>Methods for rendering, performing actions, and computing rewards.</ul>

<b>QLearning Class</b>
Implements the Q-learning algorithm, covering:
  <ul>Initialization and Q-table updates</ul>
  <ul>Action selection strategies (exploration vs. exploitation)</ul>
  <ul>Learning parameters such as exploration rate, discount factor, and learning rate</ul>
